# realFluidFoam-6

## General Information
A low Mach number solver for simulations of turbulent flows at trancritical and supercritical conditions in OpenFOAM 6.0. This solver is developed based on the real-fluid based _thermophysicalModels_ libary [1] and _reactingFoam_ solver. In this solver, a pressure-based solution method with a modified PIMPLE algorithm [2] is employed to improve the stability while a fast and robust coupling Newton-Bisection algorithm is utilized to guarantee the convergency of fluid flow simulations under transcritical and supercritical conditions.

## Real-fluid models can be used with this solver
- Modified Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) model for equation of state [3, 4].
- Peng-Robinson (PR) model for equation of state [5]
- JANAF-based model for real-fluid thermodynamic properties.
- Chung's model (1988) for dynamic viscosity and thermal conductivity [6].

## Installation
- Since this solver is developed based on OpenFOAM 6.0 in Linux operating systems, the complete installation of OpenFOAM 6.0 framework is required. 
- Prepare a directory on your system, e.g., _yourDirectory_:

		mkdir ~/OpenFOAM/yourDirectory/
		cd ~/OpenFOAM/yourDirectory/	
- Download source files using git: 

		git clone https://github.com/danhnam11/realFluidFoam-6.git

- Specify the path of your _src_ directory to an environment variable, _LIB_rfFoam_SRC_. For example:

		echo "export LIB_rfFoam_SRC=~/OpenFOAM/yourDirectory/realFluidFoam-6/src/" >> ~/.bashrc
		source ~/.bashrc
- To compile the necessary libraries and solver, go to _realFluidFoam-6_ directory and run the _Allwmake_ script:

		cd ~/OpenFOAM/yourDirectory/realFluidFoam-6/
		./Allwmake

- Now all necessary libraries inlcuding the real-fluid based _thermophysicalModels_ and _realFluidFoam_ solver are stored at _$FOAM_USER_LIBBIN_ and _$FOAM_USER_APPBIN_ directory. These newly compiled libraries and solver are ready to be used.

- To remove all compiled libraries and solvers, go to _realFluidFoam-6_ directory and run the _Allwclean_ script:

		cd ~/OpenFOAM/yourDirectory/realFluidFoam-6/
		./Allwclean

## Using realFluidFoam solver 
- Upon completing the compilation process, the solver can be utilized with different real-fluid models by simply typing _realFluidFoam_ in the terminal. 
- It is of importance to note that the runtime names of real-fluid thermophysical models also need to be specified correctly. For details of using real-fluid models, reader can refer to https://github.com/danhnam11/realFluidThermophysicalModels-6 
- Readers are referred to our paper for the validation of the new solver.
